last summer, i spent my vacation by the sea. i enjoyed swimming, sunbathing, and playing beach volleyball with my friends. 
the weather was perfect, and i returned home refreshed and full of energy. we also went on a boat trip where we saw dolphins and beautiful coastal landscapes.
 in the evenings, we had dinner in small seaside restaurants, where i tried local seafood dishes. i also took many photos to remember this wonderful time.
  these memories will stay with me for a long time, and i canâ€™t wait to go back next summer.
