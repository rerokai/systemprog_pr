Last summer, I spent my vacation by the sea. I enjoyed swimming, sunbathing, and playing beach volleyball with my friends. 
The weather was perfect, and I returned home refreshed and full of energy. We also went on a boat trip where we saw dolphins and beautiful coastal landscapes.
 In the evenings, we had dinner in small seaside restaurants, where I tried local seafood dishes. I also took many photos to remember this wonderful time.
  These memories will stay with me for a long time, and I canâ€™t wait to go back next summer.
